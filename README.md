# discord-music-bot-js
Simple music bot for discord

To use, edit the config.js file and add your token. In the groups, add an array of groups where you want the bot to function. Note that you should add it not as an integer, but as a string for it to work properly.
There are other configurations, but I recommend only making changes if you know what you're doing.
